### Accessibility Enhancements

#### ✅ Semantic HTML & ARIA
- Added `role="banner"` to header

#### ✅ Skip Links
```tsx
<a
  href="#main-content"
  className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:top-4 focus:left-4 focus:z-50"
>
  Aller au contenu principal
</a>
```
- Visible on keyboard focus
- Positioned in top-left corner
- High z-index for visibility

### Performance Optimizations

#### ✅ Glassmorphism Performance
```css
.glass-surface {
  will-change: backdrop-filter;
  transform: translateZ(0);  /* GPU acceleration */
  transition: all var(--md-sys-motion-duration-medium2);
}
```

- GPU acceleration for all glass surfaces
- Optimized blur radius (20px desktop, 12px mobile)
- Reduced motion fallback implemented
- Maximum 2-3 glass elements per viewport

#### ✅ Animation Performance
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```
